            <p>My name is Michael Andrews. I have about 17 yearsCoding is fun but has also been a challenge for me. I
                have a system administrator and data center background and
                have never had to code. In supporting various linux systems, I have a need to understand coding. Since
                the Information Technology industry is moving to mostly cloud
                based solutions. I decided to challenge myself and aquire the skill of coding. I hope that this course
                helps me in my career path.</p>
