For this project we were required to create a portfolio page using advanced CSS.
This portfolio includes my name and photo with a short article about me.
I have added place holders for different sections throughout the pages

When clicking on one of the navigation links the page will scroll to the corresponding section of the page.
There is a hyperlink that will open and new window and take you to my password generator that was created.
